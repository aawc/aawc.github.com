My name is Varun Khaneja. I'm a software engineer on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
I have the following qualities:
- I am bad at writing about myself.
- I like to challenge myself about things I'm not good at.

### My work

Design and implement state-of-the-art protections to keep Chrome users safe from
visiting phishing sites, downloading malware, or harming their internet
experience.

My work is widely deployed and likely actively used by more people than the
number of individuals in [4 degrees of separation](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/technology/between-you-and-me-4-74-degrees.html) from me.

### My history

Nothing remarkable.
