My name is Varun Khaneja. I'm a software engineer on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
I have the following qualities:
1. I'm bad at writing about myself.
2. I like to challenge myself about things I'm bad at.

### My work

Design and implement state-of-the-art protections to keep Chrome users safe from
visiting phishing sites, downloading malware, or harming their internet
experience.

As of May 2019, my work keeps an estimated 3 billion users safe online.
To put that into context, the [world population is approximately 7.7 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_population&oldid=896031034).

### My history

Nothing remarkable.
